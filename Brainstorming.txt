Player - Undercover female cop




Setting - Urban City

	The city will be populated by AI citizens - every day people, going about their business doing random stuff.
	Nightlife type setting - Albaquerky New Mexico
	




Opposition - Committee of 300
	
	This will be an international organization, but the player doesn't know that at the beginning of the game. Essentially, the player starts off
	walking around in this city, doing every day life. Then they start noticing people off, and start noticing the effects of a virus and people turning into zombies. 
	
	Turns out, the committee of 300 has sent people into this city to begin INTENTIONALLY infecting people (we don't know why yet). 
	
	Slow build-up. Psychological thriller approach to gameplay.
	

Gameplay
	You're walking around the city, trying to find these people (usually average looking citizens) in the crowds of people, and kill them. 

	Later on, people can turn into zombies and will chase you around.
	
	You can also call 911 and try to get infected people into hospitals.
